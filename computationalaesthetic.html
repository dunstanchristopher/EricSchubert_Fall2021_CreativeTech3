<h1>Computational Aesthetic</h1> 
<p><b>The Brief:</b> Create an object in Unity or any other environment of your choosing and color it using shaders in a way that “makes sense”</p>
<p><b>My response:</b>For this project I created a creature that would measure the anger of a mad queen on a faraway planet through a force sensor hidden inside a stress ball.<br>The data from the force sensor travels through Adafruit IO to alert the people living on the planet of the queen's mood.</p>
